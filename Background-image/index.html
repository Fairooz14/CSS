        <p><b><i>Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus.<span id="s1">Translation: Never tickle sleeping dragons.</span>At first glance it seems like another one of Dumbledores many eccentricities. Not to mention good advise. Because let's be Sirius. You don't mess with fire breathing lizards in their downtime.But a deeper meaning exists. A much more badass meaning. It's a warning you see.Hogwarts is the sleeping dragon. Its purpose is to educate and train the wizards of tomorrow. It is of no threat to anyone. Unless you piss it off. <span id="s2">You march on Hogwarts and you better be ready to die.</span> Painfully.</i></b></p>
