        <h2>The birth of 90s dance music</h2>
        <p>In the 90s, an entire generation seemingly turned onto electronica, with snooty indie types attending raves and turning into overnight converts. As 90s dance music added ever more subgenres and a parade of innovative acts to the scene, more and more sections of the record-buying public caved in, whether it was students rushing to get down to The Chemical Brothers’ block rockin’ beats, journalists enthusing about the cut-up lyrics of Underworld, or middle-aged prog rockers appreciating the ambient soundscapes of The Orb. It seemed that, coupled with the easy collaboration between the worlds of electronica and the similarly sample-heavy hip-hop (which staged its own world domination in the 90s), rock music had finally met a serious contender. Every man and his dog was coming up with electronic releases, and a shocking amount of it was selling well – whether in HMV or out the back of cars.</p>
        <p>In the UK, the summer of 1989 was dominated by Jazzie B. His Soul II Soul group’s blissed-out “Back To Life (However Do You Want Me),” and the accompanying Club Classics Vol One album, showed the first hints of the auteur-led projects which later came to prominence.</p>
        <h2>Massive Attack and the Bristol scene</h2>
        <p>In 1991, piano house and garage hits of various shades came at an ever-increasing speed, in the form of undeniable classics such as Brothers In Rhythm’s “Such A Good Feeling,” Crystal Waters’ “Gypsy Woman,” and CeCe Peniston’s “Finally.” In another room, Massive Attack appeared to emerge fully-formed, from Bristol, to further Soul II Soul’s downtempo, multi-faceted approach to the new sounds, forging a new path for 90s dance music and, in the process, kick-starting an extremely fertile period for the West Country city.

        </p>
        <h2>Backlash, legacy, and resurgence</h2>
        <p>The era came to something of a juddering halt as, mirroring the disco backlash of the late 70s, the new millennium saw crowds tiring of the scene’s overt commercialism. At the end of the decade, the faster side of 90s dance music, such as trance and hard house (which had thrown up lovely pieces such as Robert Miles’ timeless “Children” (1995)), had become bland. It closed with Moby interrupting wall-to-wall Eurodance smashes with the gargantuan techno-lite success of Play, which turned out to be tremendously adaptable for films and adverts alike.</p>
        <p>Underground, though, the house and garage beats continued pumping. Bassy cuts such as Armand Van Helden’s take on CJ Bolland’s “Sugar Is Sweeter” had signaled the start of UK garage in 1996, adapting the particularly pacey drum’n’bass sound to a tempo which most could live with. UK garage would endlessly morph in the coming decade, leading to grime, dubstep, and much more.</p>
